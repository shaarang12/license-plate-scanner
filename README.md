## Overview
The License Plate Recognizer is a machine learning-based project designed to recognize and extract license plate information from images or videos. This repository includes the machine learning model for license plate recognition and a user-friendly frontend for interacting with the model.

## Demo

## Machine Learning Model
The license plate recognition model uses deep learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) methods.

## Frontend
The frontend of the License Plate Recognizer was built using Streamlit. It allows users to upload images or videos and obtain the recognized license plate information. The frontend communicates with the machine learning model, providing a user-friendly interface for both individual users and organizations.
